   </u></b></center>Converge is the best site for all your email work if you dont want to go to a very complicated site.
        Through converge you can easily send your emails by just typing the name of receiver, e-mail of reciever and the message. 
        Though it is not complete ,for now your message and details will be saved in the google spreadsheet from where it will be directed 
        to the reciever once the site is complete. You can access the datasheet from the "Sentbox" section, which stores the data 
        of all the contacts and emails that we have stored from here.
